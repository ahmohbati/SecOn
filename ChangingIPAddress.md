#### Introduction ####

If you need to update the IP address of your server/sensor to move it to a different area of your network, you need to do a few things:
  * update the actual IP address of the management interface
  * update NSM config files to reflect the new IP address

#### Update the actual IP address of the management interface ####
To update the actual IP address of the management interface, you have two options:
  * manually update /etc/network/interfaces
OR
  * re-run the FIRST phase of Setup (select "Yes, configure /etc/network/interfaces)

#### Update NSM config files to reflect the new IP address ####
To update NSM config files to reflect the new IP address, you have two options:
  * re-run the SECOND phase of Setup on all server/sensors (wiping all data and config)
OR
  * manually update the IP address as shown below

### Files to update when changing the IP address ###

#### Changing Server IP ####

  * /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/http\_agent.conf:
```
set SERVER_HOST [SERVER-IP]
```

  * /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/pads\_agent.conf:
```
set SERVER_HOST [SERVER-IP]
```

  * /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/pcap\_agent.conf:
```
set SERVER_HOST [SERVER-IP]
```

  * /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/sancp\_agent.conf:
```
set SERVER_HOST [SERVER-IP]
```

  * /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/sensor.conf:
```
SENSOR_SERVER_HOST="[SERVER-IP]"
```

  * /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/snort\_agent-N.conf:
```
set SERVER_HOST [SERVER-IP]
```

  * /etc/nsm/ossec/ossec\_agent.conf:
```
set SERVER_HOST [SERVER-IP]
```

  * /root/.ssh/securityonion\_ssh.conf
```
SERVERNAME=[SERVER-IP]
```

  * /etc/elsa\_web.conf
```
"pcap_url": "https://[SERVER-IP]/capme"
```

  * /etc/salt/minion.d/onionsalt.conf
```
master: [SERVER-IP]
```

#### Automating the change of the server IP ####
You may be able to use sed to update all files at once using something like this:
```
sudo service nsm stop
sudo sed -i 's|OLD.SERVER.IP.ADDR|NEW.SERVER.IP.ADDR|g' /etc/nsm/*/*agent* /etc/nsm/*/sensor.conf /root/.ssh/securityonion_ssh.conf /etc/salt/minion.d/onionsalt.conf /etc/elsa_web.conf
sudo service nsm start
```
