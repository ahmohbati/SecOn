* Snorby has its own MySQL database (separate from the Sguil and ELSA databases)

* Log into Snorby using the EMAIL ADDRESS and password you specified in Setup

* The Snorby database only stores NIDS alerts from Snort or Suricata

* Pivot from a NIDS alert in Snorby to CapME to access full packet capture

* Pivot from an IP address in Snorby to ELSA for related logs (Bro logs, OSSEC logs, syslog)

* If you need to wipe the Snorby database, please see:
