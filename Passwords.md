#### OS root account ####

Like other Ubuntu-based distributions, there is no root password. Your default user account has been given sudo permissions. Graphical utilities requesting administrative access should prompt for password; enter your user password. Command-line utilities that require administrative access can be prefixed with `sudo`. For example, to add an OS user account:
```
sudo adduser mynewuseraccount
```

#### Sguil ####
Log into Sguil using the username/password you created in the Setup wizard..  

You can add accounts as follows (please note that Sguil usernames must be alphanumeric): 
```
sudo nsm_server_user-add
```
You can change passwords using the Sguil client (File --> Change Password) or as follows: 
```
sudo nsm_server_user-passwd
```
You can disable accounts as follows:
```
sudo nsm_server_user-disable
```

#### Squert ####
Squert authenticates against the Sguil user database, so you should be able to login to Squert using the same username/password you use to login to Sguil.

#### ELSA ####
ELSA authenticates against the Sguil user database, so you should be able to login to ELSA using the same username/password you use to login to Sguil.

#### Snorby ####
**Please note**: Snorby has been removed in the new Security Onion 14.04, but this note is left here for legacy documentation purposes.<br/><br/>
Snorby does not authenticate against the Sguil user database.  Log into Snorby using the EMAIL ADDRESS and password you specified in Setup.

#### Reset Snorby Password ####
To reset your Snorby password, first open the Rails console:
```
cd /opt/snorby/
sudo RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails c
```
In the Rails console, reset your Snorby password as follows:
```
u = User.find_by_email("foo@bar.com")
u.password="NewUnencryptedPassword123"
u.password_confirmation="NewUnencryptedPassword123"
u.save
quit
```

#### MySQL ####
The MySQL root password is null to allow the NSMnow administration scripts to add/delete sensors properly. MySQL only allows connections from localhost.  If you need to look at the database manually, you can do so like this:
```
sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf
```
