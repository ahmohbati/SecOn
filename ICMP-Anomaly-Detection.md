### Description
At Security Onion Conference 2016, Eric Conrad shared some IDS rules for detecting unusual ICMP echo requests/replies and identifying C2 channels that may utilize ICMP tunneling for covert communication.  

### Usage
We can add the rules to `/etc/nsm/rules/local.rules` and the variables to snort.conf/suricata.yaml so that we can gain better insight into ICMP echoes or replies over a certain size, containing particularly suspicious content, etc.
