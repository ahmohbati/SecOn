This page contains legacy information for versions of Setup older than securityonion-setup - 20120912-0ubuntu0securityonion201.  

If you're running securityonion-setup - 20120912-0ubuntu0securityonion201 or newer, please see the [current firewall documentation](firewall).

## Tightening the firewall on a master server ##

By default, older versions of Setup configure a master server to allow connections to the following ports from **any** IP address:
  * 22 - SSH
  * 443 - Squert/ELSA/CapMe
  * 514 - Syslog
  * 1514/udp - OSSEC
  * 7734 - Sguil client
  * 7736 - sensor connection to sguild

You may want to restrict those ports to only accepting connections from a subset of IP addresses.

NOTE! Before attempting any firewall changes, you should always ensure you have a backup plan should you accidentally block your own connection.  So make sure that you have DRAC/KVM/physical or some other form of access.

### Firewall rules to allow sensors to connect to master ###
First, add a rule like the following for each of your sensors (replacing a.b.c.d with the actual IP address of the sensor) to connect to ports 22 (SSH) and 7736 (sguild):
```
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from a.b.c.d to any port 22,7736
```

-OR-

If you're running [Salt](Salt), then sensors need to connect to ports 4505/tcp and 4506/tcp:
```
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from a.b.c.d to any port 22,4505,4506,7736
```


### Firewall rules to allow syslog devices ###
Next add a rule like the following for the IP addresses that will be sending syslog (port 514 tcp and udp):
```
sudo ufw allow from a.b.c.d to any port 514
```

### Firewall rules to allow OSSEC agents ###
Next add a rule like the following for the IP addresses that will be running the OSSEC agent (port 1514 udp):
```
sudo ufw allow proto udp from a.b.c.d to any port 1514
```

### Firewall rules to allow analysts/administrators to connect to master ###
Then add a rule like the following for the IP addresses or subnet that you'll be using to connect to the master as an analyst/administrator to ports 22 (SSH), 443 (Squert/ELSA/CapMe), 7734 (Sguil client):
```
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from a.b.c.d to any port 22,443,7734
```

### Remove default "allow from Anywhere" rules ###
Once you've added these new rules, then you can remove the default "allow from Anywhere" rules.
```
sudo ufw delete allow 22/tcp 
sudo ufw delete allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw delete allow 444/tcp
sudo ufw delete allow 514
sudo ufw delete allow 1514/udp
sudo ufw delete allow 3154/tcp
sudo ufw delete allow 7734/tcp
sudo ufw delete allow 7736/tcp
```

## Tightening the firewall on a sensor ##

By default, a sensor allows connections to the following ports from **any** IP address:
  * 22 - SSH
  * 514 - Syslog
  * 1514/udp - OSSEC

You may want to restrict those ports to only accepting connections from a subset of IP addresses.

NOTE! Before attempting any firewall changes, you should always ensure you have a backup plan should you accidentally block your own connection.  So make sure that you have DRAC/KVM/physical or some other form of access.

Next add a rule like the following for the IP addresses that will be running the OSSEC agent (port 1514 udp):
```
sudo ufw allow proto udp from a.b.c.d to any port 1514
```

### Firewall rules to allow analysts/administrators to connect to master ###
Then add a rule like the following for the IP addresses or subnet that you'll be using to connect to the sensor as an analyst/administrator to ports 22:
```
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from a.b.c.d to any port 22
```

### Remove default "allow from Anywhere" rules ###
Once you've added these new rules, then you can remove the default "allow from Anywhere" rules.
```
sudo ufw delete allow 22/tcp 
sudo ufw delete allow 514
sudo ufw delete allow 1514/udp
```
