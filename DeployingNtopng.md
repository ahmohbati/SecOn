## The latest-stable version of ntopng can now be installed on the latest-stable version of Security Onion 14.04.

Installer script maintained here:

March 3,2016: The ntopng developers recently introduced a new dependency into ntopng.  Any subsequent runs of my installer script resulted in ntopng failing to start due to an unmet library dependency.  This has now been corrected.
