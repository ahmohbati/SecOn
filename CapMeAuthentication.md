#### CapME ####
CapME allows you to:
* view a pcap transcript rendered with tcpflow
* view a pcap transcript rendered with Bro (especially helpful for dealing with gzip encoding)
* download a pcap

#### Pivoting to CapME ####
Our Setup script automatically configures ELSA to be able to pivot to CapME for full transcripts.  

As of securityonion-squert - 20141015-0ubuntu0securityonion15 (released on 6/6/2016), Squert can now pivot to CapME as well.  For more information, please see:

#### Authenticating to CapME ####
The CapME page will prompt you for username/password and you will enter your normal Sguil/Squert/ELSA username/password.  

As of securityonion-capme - 20121213-0ubuntu0securityonion59 released on 6/6/2016, CapMe now includes session support so you won't have to re-authenticate every time.  For more information, please see:
