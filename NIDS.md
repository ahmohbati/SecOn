### What is a NIDS?
NIDS stands for Network Intrusion Detection System.  It is a means of monitoring network traffic, looking for specific activity, and generating alerts.

Security Onion gives you the option of either [Snort](Snort) or [Suricata](Suricata) as your Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).  We compile both of these with [PF_RING](PF_RING) for higher performance.

NIDS alerts are visible in:
- [Squert](Squert)
- [ELSA](ELSA)
- [Sguil](Sguil)
